## About Me

I recently graduated the Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign during the pandemic. 
I studied Political Science and Linguistics in undergrad but I always had an instrinsic curiosity
toward Computer Science since I was a little girl. I wanted to challenge my intellectual capability in
engineering and decided to go back to school for the Illinois Computing Accelerator for Non-Specialists (iCAN) program
that UIUC offered for college graduates witho non-CS degrees interested in switching their life careers.
I am completing my last semester of the iCAN program this Summer 2022, where I am researching topics in
robotics and motion planning at the Parasol Lab.
