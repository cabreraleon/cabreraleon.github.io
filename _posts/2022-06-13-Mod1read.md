In this section, I will explain key motion planning and robotic terminlogoy and concepts introduced in the required reading, “Chapter 3: Configuration Space” found in Principles of Robot Motion: Theory, Algorithms, and Implementations by Choset et al (2005). This chapter argues that motion plans require us to give a specification of the location of every point of the robot to ensure that no point on the system collides with an obstacle. This chapter introduced concepts such as the configuration of a robot, degrees of freedom (DOF), configuration space (C-Space), configuration space obstacles (C-Obst) and free configuration space (C-Free). 

<br>      

The **configuration** of a robot system is a complete specification of the position of every point in that system. The **degrees of freedom** of a robot is the dimension of the configuration space. DOFs indicate the minimum number of parameters needed to specify the configuration. The **C-space** of a robot system is the space of all possible configurations of the system. The **C-Free** is the set of feasible configurations at which the robot does not intersect any obstacles. The **C-Obst** is the set of non-feasible configurations at which the robot intersects an obstacle in the workspace. The **∂C-Obst** is is the set of points in C-space which have neighbors in both C-Obst and C-Free. In other words,  this set of placements are where the robot contacts the obstacle but can still pass through it. This term can be traced back to set theory in calculus.

The most insightful part of my reading  was the visualization of a robot in a two-dimensional ambient space — referred to as  the workspace — into the  C-space. Figure 1 and Figure 2 are found in the Principles of Robot Motion reading. In Figure 1: (a) a circular mobile robot approaches the workspace polygon obstacle and (b) slides around the obstacle to find the constraints this obstacle places on its configuration. By keeping track of the curve traced out by the center reference point, one can construct the C-Obst. In Figure 1(c), the motion planning for the circular robot in the workspace seen in Figure 1(a) was transformed into motion planning for a point robot in the C-space.

In Figure 2, three (point, circular, larger circular) mobile robots of different radii in the same environment each try to find a path from one configuration to the second one. The workplace representation of the robot is transformed into C-space representation by “growing” the polygon obstacle’s walls outward and the walls inward. It might seem like the robots in Figure 1 (c) shrunk, but in reality, the obstacles “grew” when accounting for the points occupied by the robot body’s volume, thus making it easier to see that it has no solution. Although these two figures are simplifications of motion planning problems, it was much easier to think about points moving around a space than bodies with volumes.

Some terminology in my technical readings were worded with advanced verbiage and led to more questions. My mentor and other graduate students at Parasol thoroughly taught me key robotic vocabulary and now, I can define them in my own simple words. A **robot** is a rigid or articulated object that exists within the environment it is moving in. A robot’s **environment** can be composed of free space, obstacles and less commonly, the border that encloses the area such as walls. A robot has a **holonomic constraint** when the state is only dependent on its current position, such as cleaning iRobots. A robot has a **nonholonomic constraint** when the state is only dependent on its previous position and times, such as cars. Nonholonomic robots may have **kinematic constraints** on the movement of its mechanical components, such as its position, velocity, or acceleration. Below, I created a tree diagram to simplify how to decide if a robot is holonomic or non-holonomic.
