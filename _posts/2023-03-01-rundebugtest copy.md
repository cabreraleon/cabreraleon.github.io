title: Steps 7 and 8 - Run, Debug, and Test the AdaptiveConnector.h
---

This week, I worked on the last two steps of my [Refactoring Plan](https://cabreraleon.github.io/ANCrefactorplan/). Running and debugging code is challenging. You fix one thing, another bug crawls in your code. This process has been difficult so far.

### Step 7. Run the Adaprive Connector code. If the code contains a bug, locate, dissect, and debug it. Repeat until the program returns the expected output file, which must be a connected graph G with additional edges.
   

### Step 8. Develop tests for the Adaptive Connector code to ensure that the output is expected, correct, *and* reliable. The tests must be unique, in varying environments with varying k-values, and signifanct.
    If the tests pass, the refactoring of the ANC method has been successful. If the tests fail, this means the ANC method has silent bugs or fundamental flaws that have made the code to act unexpectedly, incorrectly, and unreliably and you must return to Step 7 until your ANC method succeeds all its test cases. <br>
