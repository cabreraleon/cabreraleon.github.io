title: Module 2 - Experimenting with PRMs
---

I experimented with PRMs to discover how the number of samples and edges per vertex affect the quality and connectivity of a roadmap in two distinct environments: Topo, without narrow passage, and Narrow, with a narrow passage.<br>

---

## Topo PRM Environment
Topo has six obstacles spaced out from each other. The PRM baseline had 25 samples and 5 edges per vertex and produced 27 nodes and 120 edges in 4.11 seconds, which produced a weakly connected roadmap due to the very few nodes and edges produced. I will experiment with PRM values when (A) samples are increased to 100, (B) edges are increased to 10, and (C) samples are increased to 100 and edges increased to 10. <br>

**Hypothesis:** Larger samples and edges metrics in a PRM planner will generate more nodes and edges. The roadmap connectivity will improve but the  planning time will decrease. <br>

## Narrow PRM Environment  
The Narrow PRM baseline had 25 samples and 5 edges per vertex and produced 1,202 nodes and 11,562 edges in 33.7 seconds, which produced a strong, very well-connected roadmap due to the 1,000+ nodes and edges produced. I will experiment with PRM values when (A) samples are increased to 100, (B) edges are increased to 10, and (C) samples are increased to 100 and edges increased to 10.<br>

**Hypothesis:** As samples and edges per vertex increase, the number of edges will decrease because the narrow passage created by the obstacles will affect the connectivity in the C-free space surrounding the obstacles, thus planning time will be faster.<br>

### Results 

My hypothesis on Topo was partially correct. My results showed that as samples and edges increase, more nodes and edges are generated and the images do show a more connected roadmap, which is what I hypothesized. However, whereas I expected faster times, the planning time increased. The less abstract the roadmap connectivity is, the more time it takes to plan it because there are less nodes and edges to generate and plot in the environment. My hypothesis on Narrow was incorrect. My results show that when there is a narrow passage in the environment, significantly more nodes and edges are produced by the PRM planner compared to environments with no narrow passage. More planning time is required to generate more edges.

The roadmap’s performance in the Topo and Narrow environments are mainly different but there is one similarity. Both Topo and Narrow have roadmaps that seem to have been plotted randomly because there are vertices and edges that are on the obstacle or pass through it even if following such a path leads to colliding with that obstacle. This might be due to the fact that it is computationally expensive to deal with collision detection (CD). However, in Topo, some paths can take you from completely different sides of the environment without colliding with any obstacles. On the other hand, Narrow does not have a solution; no paths in the roadmap can successfully pass through the narrow passage between the two obstacles without colliding.

There were some questions that arose during the Narrow experimentation process. I was unsure why in vizmo, the Narrow roadmaps had the exact same number of nodes for all four of its experiments. How could 25 samples with 5 edges per vertex generate the same amount of nodes as 100 samples with 10 edges per vertex? Another question is why the PRM set to number=100 and k=10 produced less edges than the PRM set to number=25 and k=10. I expected the number of nodes and edges to also increase as the samples and/or edges increased, but this part of my hypothesis was wrong. I re-ran the Narrow experiments twice to ensure consistent results, but each run returned the same data.

I found it strange that in Narrow, the nodes and edges split in two entirely different regions that were separated by the two objects in the middle. There was a cluster of nodes and edges on the left side, and another cluster on the right. There was no connectivity between the two clusters above or below the obstacles. It is as if the narrow pathway obstructed the visibility of the planning performance, and it was not possible to create any other solution in the environment’s free space. This is distinct from Topo, which has no narrow pathway and therefore has better visibility during planning performance. In Topo, there are edges and nodes all around most of the obstacles, and there is better connectivity in the roadmap.

### Conclusion

It was interesting to learn how to build a roadmap graph over the C-space and how important sampling is to approximate C-Free. It was also insightful to see  how varying parameter values of number samples and k edges per vertex  defined the quality and connectedness of a roadmap. 

II. Experimenting with RRTs
In this experiment, I explored and approximated the C-space using one of the most fundamental algorithms in sampling-based motion planning, the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT).  I used the same ProblemDefinition.xml file and Topo and Narrow environments that I used in my previous PRM experiment.
