title: My PPL Open-Source Project
---

After I completed all my crash course modules, I was assigned to a Parasol team to research and refactor code in the Parasol Planning Library. I was placed in the Local Planner group and was tasked to refactor C++ code for the Adaptive Neighborhood Connector algorithm. The original ANC code was found in the AdaptiveConnector.h file on the Parasol Laboratory’s master branch in the PPL GitLab and was last edited over two years ago. The last commit involved making the “merging with the cc-tracker work”. I added the Adaptive Connector file to its own AdaptiveConnector branch. All my work was pushed to this AdaptiveConnector branch to avoid interfering with the code base in other branches. Once checked-in to the AdaptiveConnector branch, my progress file can be found in the following GitLab directory: src/MPLibrary/Connectors, src/Test/XMLs, and pmpl/src/Testing/MPLibrary/Connectors. Once the code has been satisfactorily refactored after successful runs and tests, it will be pushed to the master branch for public use.
