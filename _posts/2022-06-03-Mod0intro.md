title: Module 0 - Introduction

## Introuduction 

Motion planning is a branch of robotics that, given an environment with a moveable robot, obstacles, and start and goal configurations, computes a valid collision-free path that takes the robot from a start to a goal position. For the PPL crash course, I completed five modules where I read revolutionary research papers on motion planning and robotics; coded motion planning programs in C++ and XML; experimented with varying environments, planners, robots, algorithms, and other parameters; improved my debugging strategies; wrote reports on my experiment results; and completed quizzes.


## Environment Set Up
For the initial Module 0 of the crashcourse, I requested access to the Parasol virtual machines (VM), laboratory facility, and added [myself](https://parasollab.web.illinois.edu/people/aec4/) to the Parasol website. My work was done on the Black Widowers and Nancy Drew VMs, which run on MATE Linux. I configured the FastX3 toolkit to render the remote laboratory Linux servers on my laptop. My laptop model is Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Generation 9, runs on Ubuntu Linux 22.04, has 16.0 gibibyte memory, and a 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i5-1135G7 @ 2.40GHz × 8 processor. Now that I have set up the environment I will work in, I am all set to start my laboratory work!
