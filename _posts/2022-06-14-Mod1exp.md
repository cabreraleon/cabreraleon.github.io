title: Module 1 - Experiments

In the Module 1 Experiment, I learned how to checkout, compile and execute PPL code. <br>

1. I checked out the PPL motion planning code, which means I made my own local copy of the Parasol GitLab repository. <br>

2. I checked out the libraries that make up PPL utilities. A few main directories and files of PPL are Behaviors, ConfigurationSpace, Examples, MPLibrary, MPProblems, Test, Traits, Utilities, Workspace, Makefile, and main.cpp. The core directory is MPLibrary, which contains all our libraries used to solve motion planning problems, and includes open-source code for Connectors, DistanceMetrics, LocalPlanners, MapEvaluators, Metrics, MPStrategies, MPTools, Samplers, NeighborhoodFinders, ValidityCheckers, and more.  <br>


3. I checked out and built the vizmo visual tool on my Linux machine. A doctorate-candidate student, Irving Solis, taught me how to create an alias on the terminal in order to open the software in less than a second by typing “vizmo” anywhere in my local PPL directory instead of manually entering multiple directories to reach the software location.  <br>


4. I learned how to compile and run code in vizmo via crucial command such as “make clean/reallyclean/reallyreallyclean” and “make pmpl”.  I also ran a CfgExamples.xml file with MP examples and observed its components and output roadmap (.map) and statistics (.stat) files. “Cfg” is shorthand for “Configuration”.I put the example roadmap output file, 3D environment file, and the 3D boxy robot in vizmo. I successfully used vizmo to create the roadmap below and learned how to navigate the software and how to change its settings.  I also played with the system by varying the number of nodes, samples or connectors in the XML and visually observing how it changed the output files. <br>
