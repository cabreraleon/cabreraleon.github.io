title: Refactoring the ANC Algorithm
---

To refactor the ANC algorithm, I first had to search for the original research paper associated with the code in the Parasol Planning Library. After the research paper was located with the help of my graduate mentor, I read through it to understand the algorithm and the motivation behind its development and analyzed the pseudocode. With the help of my two advisors, I parsed through the pseudocode and tried to map it to the raw code in the AdaptiveConnector.h file in our PPL database.
