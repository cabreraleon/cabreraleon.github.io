1. **What are the major strengths and weaknesses of PRMs?**	<br>
    One major strength of the PRM algorithm is versatility, as it can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robots as well as nonholonomic robots. A PRM is also reusable since it can run many distinct queries. Another strength is that it works fast. For example, roadmaps can be constructed in seconds for easier problems and queries can be processed in a fraction of a second (Latombe et al, 1996). These fast, small query times makes it possible for the PRM to work with robots with many DOFs performing several point-to-point motions in workspaces with static obstacles. <br>

    Another major strength is that the PRM learning and query phase is not limited to be executed sequentially. Each phase can be "interwoven" with each other to adapt the size of the already-created roadmap to address difficulties encountered during the query phase. I think it's beneficial that the PRM isn't a one-shot method. One other major strength is that the local paths are not required to be memorized (unless a non-deterministic local planner is used) during the learning phase because recomputing them during the query time is inexpensive. <br>

    A PRM weakness is sampling in difficult regions such as narrow passages. Generally, in sampling-based planning, difficult regions are hard to sample in, which makes PRMs unlikely to capture the connectivity of C-Space in those regions. An example that a  laboratory doctorate student gave me was that in a 1-D narrow passage with no volume, a sampling-based method like the PRM will never be able to solve a narrow passage problem. <br>

    Another major PRM weakness is that it is expensive, tedious and time-consuming to sample for collisions using PRM. An additional major weakness is that it is also not possible to know how many samples we need to show connectivity of all the C-free space. The PRM never guarantees to fully represent free C-space connectivity. If the time spent on roadmap construction is short, PRM may not construct an adequate roadmap. Consequently, it can be difficult to certainly know if the PRM algorithm is failing to find a path because one does not exist or because it needs more samples. <br>

2. **How might you address the difficulties of PRMs?** <br>
    One of the difficulties of PRMs is solving narrow passages. One way we can address this problem is by strategically designing better sampling methods. It is critical for a roadmap to adequately capture the connectivity of the C-free space, especially in "difficult" regions that may contain narrow passages. If the roadmap connectivity is not adequate, the query will frequently fail. One thing we can do is spend more time in the learning phase or simply take advantage of the PRM’s ability to interweave the learning and query phases so that you can go back and sample more random configurations in the construction step.
    The OBPRM, a sophisticated sampling method, was introduced in Amato et al (1998) to tackle the narrow passage problem. Amato’s poster below stated the PRM method did not work well at sampling the C-Free space in the narrow passage. The OBPRM algorithm was able to find a path between the narrow passages by enhancing the PRM sampling method. This algorithm is very intuitive, and Nancy did an excellent job at tackling one of the most challenging PRM problems: the narrow passage. <br>

    If I had expert knowledge in motion planning, I would create an algorithm that mimics when a person (many-DOF system) wakes up in the middle of the night (with the lights off ) in a dark messy room and tries to find their path to the bathroom in a cluttered environment by touching the walls and obstacles around them each time before taking a step. This way, I could create a path from the person's bed to the bathroom by relying on touching the surface of the obstacles instead of relying on explored free space. Since it's very dark, we can't assume there is free space because we cannot see it. <br>

    My algorithm would assume no free space exists at first; if you touch obstacles, you can assume the place you're currently in is free, then use your arms to feel more obstacles and if you feel any obstacles, avoid the direction your arm is pointing to. If there are no obstacles at arms-length, move in any direction and stop until you encounter another obstacle, repeat the process until the end goal is reached. Also, if we could build an algorithm that mimics how "blind" people walk about in the world, it would be very fascinating to me. This idea was inspired by my conversation with Diane Uwacu, who intuitively described OBPRM as a robot navigating a narrow passage similar to how humans experience walking in a dark room. <br>

3.  **In what situation would you prefer RRT over PRM?** <br>
    I prefer RRT over PRM for motion planning problems where (1) the environment is cluttered with many obstacles, no narrow passages, and less free space and (2) the robot system is nonholonomic and has kinodynamic constraints such as velocity or position. A real life example of this would be finding a path from start to finish with a car that is constrained to only move forward and left (cannot move backward or right). In such a case, the PRM would not do well because it would have difficulty finding the connectivity between generated vertices during the query phase.  PRMs do better in environments with more C-free space where there is more connectivity and where robot systems are holonomic and don't have velocity constraints. PRMs require more expensive k-nearest neighbor queries, which is ideal for multi-query problems. On the other hand, RRTs require single nearest-neighbor queries that are less expensive.
