3. **What motivated the introduction of randomized planning algorithms such as PRMs and RRTs?** <br>
 For motion planning problems to be successful, they have to run in exponential time. However, previous algorithms had difficulties solving larger problems because the cost was too high to pay. Problems with simple obstacles had complex C-obst, C-spaces had high dimensions, and we needed something that was practical in computing the C-free space of robots with many-DOFs. Computer scientists introduced randomized planning algorithms as a way to approximate motion planning solutions in a significantly more efficient complexity: polynomial time. Although PRMs and RRTs can’t completely decide motion planning problems, they remain useful in more complex, increased dimensional C-space.

4. **Name 2 features of MP problems that do not have full heuristic or algorithmic solutions. What properties of an environment or robots greatly increase the "hardness" of an MP problem?**<br>
 Open problems in motion planning that do not yet have full  heuristic or algorithm solutions includes (1) planning paths for robots moving in environments with narrow pathways between obstacles without colliding into them and (2) planning paths for multiple robot agents to move together at the same time without colliding with each other. If you combine those issues together, it would be really complex to solve a motion planning problem with multiple robots traveling along an environment with many narrow pathways and limited free space. <br>
 Robots traveling along a narrow passage was a major motion planning problem in the past. However, narrow passages increase the hardness of a motion planning problem, there are great algorithms that can solve this problem such as OBPRM (Amato, 1998). Another property that increases a motion planning problem is when a robot has many DOFs. For example, planning the motion of a nonholonomic walking robot that looks like a human and must be programmed to walk human-like.

6. **Define degree of freedom. Name/describe as many types of DOF and/or joints for robotic systems as you can.**<br>
The degrees of freedom of a robot is the dimension of the configuration space. DOFs also indicate the minimum number of parameters needed to specify the configuration. Types of DOF include translation, rotation, orientation, velocity, and time. We can count the DOF of an open-chain jointed robot (serial mechanism) by adding the DOF at each joint. I don’t think that all the numbers of DOF  are always countable for all types of robot systems though. For example, a cloth is an example of a system with infinite DOFs. In a finite curb, you can count the DOFs. You can also count DOFs for closed-chain robots using Grübler's Formula. DOFs are more difficult to count for soft or deformable robots with significantly high counts of DOFs.  For surgical needles, a kind of deformable robot, they have wires that change their orientation and length that are hard to model and count. <br>

7. **Define Configuration, C-Space, C-Free, C-Obst, and  ∂C-Obst.** <br>
I defined all these terms in the Module 1, Readings subsection.

8. **If a robot can move and turn in the xy plane and it has a mounted camera with a view radius of 60° that can look in any direction in the plane ( not 'up' or 'down'), how many DOF does the robot have?** <br>
If the camera can look in any direction in the plane, it needs at least 2 DOF.  In this case, the hypothetical robot has 3 DOF.

9. **If a quadrotor is carrying a mobile arm attachment with 4 spherical joints, what is the dimension of its C-space?**<br>
The dimension is 18 DOF. A quadrotor has 6 DOF. A spherical join thas 3 DOF and the mobile arm attachment has 4 spherical joints, Since 3*4=12, the arm has 12 DOF. The final count is 6 + 12 = 18.

10. **How do we transform a configuration into a placement of the robot in work space? Work space placement to a configuration?** <br>

    ***Transform: C-space -> Work Space***
    <br>
    In C-Space, a particular configuration for the robot is always a single point. The single point has coordinates (floats) that represent the degrees of freedom for that robot, such as its position (x, y) or orientation (a float that represents degrees, e.g. 0.5 equals 90 degrees, 1.0 equals 180 degrees). Let's say that we have a robot that has 3 DOF and is in a 2D workspace. Its DOFs allow it to move along the x-axis, y-axis, and rotate. The robot's configuration is c = {5.0, 7.0, 0.5}. That means that in the workspace, the robot configuration point is located on the 5.0 coordinate in the x-axis, 7.0 coordinate in the y-axis, and is oriented at 90 degrees. This robot is also represented as a rectangle, where the rotation of its body is significant. Due to the configuration represented by {5.0, 7.0, 0.5}, we were able to transform the C-space into a placement of the robot in the workspace.

    ***Transform: Work Space -> C-Space***
    <br>
    In the workspace, this same configuration for the robot has physical geometry associated with it.The workspace is equal to the C-space and it can easily be transformed because the obstacles and robot maintain their geometry. We can also represent a robot's mass and radius by bordering the dot with a circle, which will end up taking more space and most-likely collide with the obstacle even if the robot's dot center does not. In this case, we will have to enlarge the obstacles in the workspace to account for the change in geometry of the robot. Consequently, the C-space can subtract the unfeasible space taken up by the enlarged obstacles to calculate the new free space, which will shrink.  If the robot system’s geometry is in collision with an obstacle, then the associated point in C-space lies in C-obst. However, if there is no collision in the workspace, the configuration lies in C-Free.

11. **Explain how you would check if a configuration is in collision with an obstacle. Define other examples of “validity” for a robot.**
<br>
One issue with collision checking is that we can rarely represent the entire C-Free or C-Obst, we can only approximate it. Therefore, it is important to rely on robot geometry and the workspace. In the C-space, each configuration for the robot is a single point. In the workspace, the same configuration has physical geometry. If this geometry is in collision with an obstacle in the workspace, then we can assume that the associated point is a configuration that lies in the C-Obst and a collision call can be made. If the geometry is not in the C-Obst, there is no collision in the workspace and it can be assumed that this configuration lies in the C-Free space and therefore is considered “valid”. Generally, without referring to robot geometry and workspace, it is not easily feasible to tell if a configuration is in collision with an obstacle.

12. **How do we geometrically compute the C-space of a robot in an environment? How can we account for this infeasibility?**
<br>
We cannot geometrically compute C-space because it is too expensive. Instead of computing C-space, we have to sample it. Check if one configuration is valid or not. If it is not, select a random sample and test it. If we spend enough time sampling, we can cover the entire space and calculate the obstacles of C-space but there is no way of knowing if we have sampled enough. With enough configuration samples, we can approximate the C-space but not completely geometrically compute it. We really cannot know for sure. This motivates sampling-based methods.
