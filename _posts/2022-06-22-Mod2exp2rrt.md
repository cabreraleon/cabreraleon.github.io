title: Module 2 - Experimenting with RRTs
---

In this experiment, I explored and approximated the C-space using one of the most fundamental algorithms in sampling-based motion planning, the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT).  I used the same ProblemDefinition.xml file and Topo and Narrow environments that I used in my previous PRM experiment.
