1. **How is the topology of a configuration space relevant to motion planning?** <br>
    A configuration space is a topological space, therefore we can concisely describe the C-space of a robot using terminology from topology. This allows us to ignore differences in the construction of spaces that don’t affect certain properties. The C-Space topology of a 2-Revolute-joint robot arm is represented by a torus, which is represented by two joint-angle coordinates between 0 and 2. When the configuration of the torus moves smoothly, the coordinate representation changes discontinuously at[0, 2)[0,2). In Figure 53, the robot arm’s movement (left) is shown on the torus (middle), and the coordinate representation jumps from one edge of the coordinate square to the other (right).<br>

2. **Define homeomorphism, diffeomorphism, manifold, differentiable manifold, and homotopy class.** <br>
    **Homeomorphism** is a mapping from one set to another which is a continuous bijection. Two sets are homeomorphic *iff* this mapping exists. This is a type of continuous transformation found in topology and can be best visualized by squishing a coffee mug into a donut, as seen in Figure 50. A **manifold** is a set which is locally homeomorphic to ℝk. **Diffeomorphism** is a smooth mapping from one set to another which is a continuous bijection. Two sets are diffeomorphic *iff* this mapping exists. A **differentiable manifold** is a set which is locally diffeomorphic to to ℝk. <br>

    **Homotopic classes** are those in which, given two topological spaces X and Y, place an equivalence relationship on the continuous maps f : X  Y using homotopies. The two spaces X and Y are homotopically equivalent if they can be transformed into one another by bending, shrinking, and expanding. An example of homotopy is the case of continuous maps from one circle to another circle. Suppose you have an infinitely stretchable string that can be tied around a tree. The string can be stretched to be the first circle S1, and the tree trunk’s surface is the second circle S1. There are many ways to tie the rope around the tree. For any integer n, the string can be wrapped around the tree n times. Each integer n corresponds to a homotopy class of maps from f: S1  S1 (Wolfram MathWorld, 2023). <br>

3. **Considering homeomorphism, how many holes does a shirt have? What about pants? Socks?** <br>

    <br>

    Given what we observed in Figure 56 through Figure 60, we can logically conclude that the opening spaces of a pants or shirt is not a hole, it simply allows us to enter the geometric space of the clothes. In pants, the first hole is for the left leg and the second hole is for the right leg. Thus, **pants have two holes**. In a shirt, the first hole is for the cranium to go through, the second hole is for the left arm, and the third hole is for the right arm. Thus, a **shirt has three holes**. <br>

4. **Use this information to answer questions 4 a-c:** <br>
    Imagine you have a robot with a mobile base and a jointed manipulator attached at the top, as in the following figure. Assume the base can only move in one dimension (along a straight line) and the manipulator only has one revolute joint (which can freely move in a circle). <br>

    <br>

    **4a. What is the shape of the C-Space for this robot?** 
        The shape of the C-Space for the robot in Figure 61 is a cylinder. I added some motion and arrows to each pair of robot and cylinder in Figure 63 to visualize their topological relationship. <br>

    **4b. How would you specify the coordinates of a configuration in this C-space?**
        I would specify the configuration with one coordinate ranging between 0 and 2π and represent it as ℝ^1 [0,2π). For Clarity: brachet, 0, comma, 2π, parenthsis. <br>
    <br>

    **4c. How could you compute the distance between two configurations in this space?**
     I would cut the cylinder to get a square subset of the plane in order to get the coordinates of the two configurations and use distance metric formulas to compute the distance between them. <br>
