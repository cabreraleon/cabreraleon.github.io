title: Module 4 - Programming in C++
---

In this assignment, I coded a motion planning program in C++. I followed detailed instructions to code an MP Strategy that generates a roadmap with 4 nodes connected by 3 edges. I worked in a 6-DOF environment where each coordinate is represented as a double. I used the 3D environment and boxy robot for my algorithm and visualized my results in vizmo.
