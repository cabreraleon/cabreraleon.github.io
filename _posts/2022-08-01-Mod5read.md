title: Module 5 - Topology
---

The required reading was Chapter section 3.4, “The Topology of the Configuration Space” found in Principles of Robot Motion: Theory, Algorithms, and Implementations by Choset et al (2005). This section introduces topology as “a branch of mathematics that considers the properties of objects that do not change when the objects are subjected to arbitrary continuous transformations such as stretching or bending” without tearing it.

To a topologist, a coffee mug and a torus are topologically equivalent: both can be transformed to one another by bending and stretching and have exactly one hole, as depicted in Figure 50 below.

**Figure 50. Continuous Transformation of a Coffee Mug to a Donut.** A coffee mug and a donut are topologically equivalent, which is illustrated by this homeomorphic transformation. (Source: https://cems.riken.jp/en/laboratory/qmtrt). <br>
<br>

Two spaces are topologically different if cutting or pasting is required to turn one into the other. This is because cutting or pasting are not considered continuous transformations. The two main continuous transformations introduced in the research paper are homeomorphism and diffeomorphism, which will be defined in the Quiz 4 section. <br>

## Individual Research
  I found a lecture video on configuration space topology given by Dr. Kevin Lynch, a professor at Northwestern University. The lecturer stated that two spaces are topologically equivalent to each other if one can be smoothly transformed to the other without cutting, pasting, or gluing. Dr. Lynch makes a distinction: the topology of a shape affects how we use coordinates to represent a space whereas he topology of a space is not affected by the choice of how to represent the space with coordinates. Topologically distinct one-dimensional spaces are lines, closed intervals of a line, and circles. Topologically distinct two-dimensional spaces are planes, spheres, torus, and cylinders. <br>

  The lecture taught me how the topology of a 2-Revolute robot arm is identical to the topology of a torus by using simple visuals and explanations. Learning a mathematical concept I thought I could not understand is a great feeling. I will use the information from Figure 51 to explain how the topology of a configuration space is relevant to motion planning in the Quiz 4 section.
