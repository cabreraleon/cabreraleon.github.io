title: Parasol Orientation
---

Today was my first day of my research program at the Parasol Laboratory. The schedule for today
was a one hour presentation to introduce us to the Parsaol Lab,
the crash course schedule, meeting dates and expectations. After this meeting,
all my labmates and I went downstairs for the first Lunch and Learn event held
by my university's Department of Computer Science.

I'm nervous yet excited about 
the challenges I will face during my research on robotics and motion planning.
A large part of me feels like I cannot do it, given that I have only
taken two semesters of introductory computer science classes as an iCAN student. 
It's hard for me to imagine being at the same level as my collegues, all who have studied
or are currently studying CS in undergraduate school and have had engineering internships before.
I have never imagine myself as a person capable of studying robotics, and 
I think this negative thinking might be my downfall if I don't motivate myself
to challenge my intellectual insecurities. I also don't want to disappoint my advisor,
the Head of the CS Department, and I certainly don't want to let down my team.

After Thoughts: My first week of research at Parasol Laboratroy was surreal, I never thought that a former political science student would make it so far in computer science. I felt brave for having stepped out of my comfort zone, shown my confidence in my intelligence to learn robotics, and courage to attend my first day of orientation.
