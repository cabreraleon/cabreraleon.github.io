# Reading: LaValle (1998) Summary
I read another historic research paper titled Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees: A New Tool for Path Planning by Steve M. LaValle (1998). The Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm returns a randomized data structure that was designed for a broad class of motion planning problems and was specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints and high degrees of freedom. The RRT, can be applied to robotic motion planning with holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic constraints.  A kinodynamic constraint is a restriction on the flexibility of the robot system without any obstacle present. For example, if a robot can rotate but only up to 30 degrees left or right, it cannot position itself to 180 degrees to move toward the space directly behind itself due to its kinodynamic constraint.

The RRT algorithm is programmed to search in a metric space X for a continuous path from an initial configuration xinit to a goal region Xgoal ⊂ (i.e. is a subset of) X or a goal configuration xgoal where C  is the configuration space of a rigid body or system of bodies and X = C . The RRT avoids with the obstacle region Xobs ⊂ X, which may contain states that correspond to velocity bounds that are configurations at which a robot is in collision with an obstacle in the world. An explicit representation of Xobs is not available, therefore the RRT can only check whether a given configuration lies in  Xobs. When an RRT is constructed, its vertices are configurations in Xfree , the complement of  Xobs , and all its edges correspond to a path that lies completely in the Xfree . 

Non-holonomic constraints are expressed by a configuration transition equation of the form   x=f(x,u). Vector u is selected from the set Uof inputs and vector x denotes the derivative of the configuration with respect to time. When f gets integrated over a fixed time interval ∆t, the next configuration,  xnew can be determined. For nonholonomic robots, xnew has a constraint due to the choice of f. For holonomic robots,  xnew  can move the robot system in any direction relative to x. The configuration transition equation for holonomic robots is express in the form of  f(x,u)=u and ||u|| ≤ 1, which means any bounded velocity can be achieved.

Figure 1. RRT Algorithm Pseudocode (LaValle, 1998)

Let p denote a distance metric on the C-space.
1. The first vertex of tree T is xinit ∈ (i.e. is an element of) Xfree .
2. For each iteration of the k-nearest neighbor value:
3. Instantiate random configuration xrand .
4. Find xnew, the closest vertex to xrand in terms of d.
5. Select an input u ∈ U that minimizes the distance from xnear and xrand. In this step, collision detection can be performed by an incremental  method, such as  the Voronoi-Clip (Mirtich, 1997). 
6. NEW_STATE is called on each input u to evaluate a  potential new configuration xnew .  If U is not finite, it can be discretized or use an alternative optimization procedure. In this step, the 
new configuration was obtained by applying u.
7. Add xnew as a vertex to T.
8. Add an edge from xnear to  xnew . Input u is recorded with the edge because this input must be applied to reach  xnear from  xnew .
9. Iteration ends once Xgoal  or xgoal is reached. Return RRT tree T. 

Below is an example to better illustrate the algorithm. The figure below shows the construction of an RRT for the case of X= [0,100] x [0,100], ∆t=1, and  xinit = (50,50). Assume that a holonomic model is used where f(x,u)=u , which implies that f=u and U={u ∈ ℝ2 |  ||u|| ≤ 1}.

Figure 2. Example of RRT Construction. An RRT is constructed in a bounded, convex region X in a plane. The RRT quickly expands in a few directions to explore the four corners of the square (LaValle, 1998).
