title: Steps 1 and 2: Find the Research Paper that Introduced the AdaptiveConnector.h and Read it
---

This week, I completed Step 1 and Step 2 of my [Refactoring Plan](https://cabreraleon.github.io/ANCrefactorplan/).

<br>

### Step 1. Find research paper that introduced the AdaptiveConnector.h. 

    The AdaptiveConnector.h code in the Parasol Planning Library was introduced in *Adaptive neighbor connection for PRMs: A Natural Fit for Heterogeneous Environments and Parallelism*
    by Chinwe Ekenna, Sam Ade Jacobs, Shawna Thomas, and Nancy M. Amato
    It was presented at the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robot Systems (IROS), in Tokyo, Japan on November 2013. This code is almost 10 years old!

    Access to the Research: [Ekenna et al (2013) Paper](files/AdaptiveNeighborhoodConnector_Ekenna_etal.pdf)

    Access to the Presentation: [Ekenna et al (2013) Slides](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5245/4b4c1bebdc6befd78376b9c9a3cf713c860e.pdf)


### Step 2. Read the research paper.

    The Adaptive Neighborhood Connector was introduced in For motion planning in heterogeneous environments and parallel machines, it can become infeasible for humans to hand-pick the best connector method for PRM variants at each step of a problem. In Heterogeneous Environments, different algorithm choices may apply for different regions. In Parallel Processing, subdivision is often used to increase parallelism so each region can be processed independently. Manually selecting a single connector across all problems can lead to poor performance overall. We need a way to automatically and adaptively select the best connector depending on the problem at hand and its input. This problem inspired Chinwe Ekenna, Sam Ade Jacobs, Shawna Thomas, Nancy M. Amato to develop the Adaptive Neighborhood Connector algorithm for robotic motion planning.


    #### Related Works

    1. **Hybrid PRMs:**
        Some works use more than 1 sampling strategy and adaptively learns which sampler to use over time. ANC works similarly but applies this methodology only in the connection phase

    2. **Candidate Neighborhood Selection Methods**
        - k-Closest: returns k -closest neighbors to a node based on distance metric (k is small constant)
        Advantage: nodes have higher chance to be connectable by LP because the C-space volume occupied by the connector is smaller 
        - R-closest: returns all neighbors within a radius r of the node determined by distance metric
        + K-Closest,K-Rand: randomly selects k neighbors from k2 closest nodes where k2 = 3k)
        + R-Closest, K-Rand: randomly selects k-random neighbors from those within distance r
    -  Distance Metrics: Euclidean, Center of Mass, Swept Volume
    - Spatial Subdivision and Parallelism
