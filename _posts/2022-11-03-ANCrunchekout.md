title: Steps 5 - Run the Code Version You Were Given, Check Out an Individual Gitlab Branch, and Start Refactoring.

---

This week, I completed Step 3 of my [Refactoring Plan](https://cabreraleon.github.io/ANCrefactorplan/).

### Step 5. Run the Code Version You Were Given, Check Out an Individual Gitlab Branch, and Start Refactoring.

  I ran the current version of the ANC code in the PPL master branch. The ANC version I was given to refactor was pushed three years ago and is the most recently released version that is currently accesible for public use. This step provided me a good indication of where the past laboratory students assigned to work on this code had left off in their refactoring process <br>

  Then, I checked out my individual PPL gitlab branch. This allowed me to refactor my code seperately without affecting the PPL codebase in the master branch or my colleagues' code elsewhere. My individual refactoring work on the Adaptice Connector was done in the AdaptiveConnector branch. <br>
