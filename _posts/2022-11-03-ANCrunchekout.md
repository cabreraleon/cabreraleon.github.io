title: Run the ANC Code in the PPL Master Branch and Start Refactoring the Program in the AdaptiveConnector Branch
---

This week, I completed Step 5 and Step 6 of my [Refactoring Plan](cabreraleon.github.io/ANCrefactorplan).

5. ### Run the code in the master branch of the PPL to see what has already been released for public use in present time.
    

6. ### Check out my own GitLab branch, AdaptiveConnector, and start my refactoring work there.
