title: Steps 5 and 6 - Run the Released ANC Code in the PPL master branch and Checkout my Own Branch
---

This week, I completed Step 3 of my [Refactoring Plan](https://cabreraleon.github.io/ANCrefactorplan/).

### Step 5. Run the code in the master branch of the PPL to see what has already been released for public use in present time.



### Step 6. Check out my own GitLab branch, AdaptiveConnector, and start my refactoring work there.
