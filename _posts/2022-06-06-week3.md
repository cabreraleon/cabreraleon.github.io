title: Week 3
---

This week, I continued working on Module 1 and started Module 2. Despite having completed Milestone 1 over a week ago, DREAM has had no communication with me toward
the payment that I was promised. I had to pick up hours at my other job so that I can affor food. 
Working a part-time job on weekends, and taking a 400-level computer science class and 
researching on weekdays  is too much to manage. If a program is going to cater to young professionals in underserved Latin, Native, and Black communities,
they should understand that not all of us are privileged to have a family or home that can help us; we cannot afford to live 3+ weeks without pay.
