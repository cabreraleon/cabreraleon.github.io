Communication with humans is just as important as communication with computers. 

When I think of working in the computer science field, I think of the struggles of dealing with computers, not the people in your lab.
But solving social situations are important too, especially with the people who you must collagborate with every day.
People in my lab have been nice and really helpful to me. I have gotten along with everyone well. However, I would 
say they do not care about my health well-being. I am currently struggling with chronic health issues (ouchies), so working
in an area where maskless people cough without covering their mouths at all (or barely onto their hands without washing them) 
constantly brings lots of stress into my life. It's especially worrisome because I don't know how COVID-19 would react with my healh issues. Even
when I get a small cold, it's pretty bad.

I have witnessed maskless people cough right next to me, behind me, infront of me, and to my face in my laboratory
without covering their mouth, despite there still being a pandemic. The day after there was a covid exposure in my lab,some didn't take 
it seriously. I let some people know that I felt uncomfortable if they didn't have face-coverings and even gave them a clean disposable mask,
but that did not matter in the long-run. Communication with humans was kinda failing me, and I had no idea how to Professionally tackle this social qualm.

The biggest social challenge I experience was when I was having a conversation with a grad student and she coughed directly onto my face.
She tried to cover her second cough with her hand but there was no point. I felt disrespected and grossed out, since there was no excuse,
but I handled it calmly. I decided to express how her actions made me feel and she apologized. For a week, I decided to 
just stay at home and go to meetings on Zoom. Eventually, I decided to make the mature decision and get over it because 
I can't make people exert basic germ-containment hygiene. I guess these situations are unavoidable in the real world.

In the real world, I can't hide in my apartment because I'm too stressed to work at the office due to protecting my health. 
What I learned from this experience was to speak up when people make me uncomfortable, even if they might not change.
There's not much else I can do.
After all, we live in a society.
