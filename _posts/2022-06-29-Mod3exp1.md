title: Module 3 - Experiment 1
---

For Module 3 Experiment 1, I tested a benchmark found in the Parasol Laboratory website. The benchmark example I will test for this experiment is the [Maze](https://parasollab.web.illinois.edu/resources/mpbenchmarks/Maze/) environment. I will use Vizmo software to visualize a probabilistic roadmap planner sampling the Maze 2-dimensional environment with a boxy robot. This test will be run on the MATE Linux virtual machine named Black Widowers.

1. ## Experimental Set-Up ####
    An important portion of this experiment was to get familiar with the code found in core MP components. I broke down the files in the benchmark and visualized the code in the chart below. 

    Files in Experiment/Maze: 
    * Environment Files: Maze-vizmo.env , maze-vizmo.env, 
    * Maze Files: maze.robot, robot.g, 
    * Query Files: maze.query, 
    * Obstacle Files: block1.g, block2.g, block3.g (longer files with many coordinates that map each obstacle)

    **Figure 32. A chart that illustrates the code in the five core files of the Maze Benchmark (Parasol Planning Library, 2022).** Maze benchmark has an environment file with obstacles (maze.env), an environment file specifically for visualizing in vizmo (maze-vizmo.env), robot files (maze.robot, robot,g), and a query file (maze.query). <br>

2. ## Evaluation 

    First, I changed the code in the Problem section of the CfgExamples.xml File to match the files of the maze example that I will be testing.

    Then, I ran a terminal command in the PMPL/pmpl/src Directory 
               ./pmpl -f Examples/CfgExamples.xml   --  to run PMPL.

3. ### Results
    Running PMPL with the CfgExamples.xml produced a file titled example.12345678.query.map that represents the probabilistic roadmap in the maze environment. In Vizmo, I uploaded the maze-vizmo.env file to visualize the maze environment as well as the example.12345678.query.map file to visualize the roadmap. The roadmap is an undirected graph R composed of nodes and edges. The configurations are the nodes of R and the paths 
    computed by the local planner are the edges of R. The image below shows the results of the vizmo representation of these files. Each color represents a connected component in this graph.<br>
