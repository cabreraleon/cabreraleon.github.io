title: Module 3 - Experiment 1
---

For Module 3 Experiment 1, I have to test a benchmark found in the Parasol Laboratory website. The benchmark example I will test for this experiment is the [Maze](https://parasollab.web.illinois.edu/resources/mpbenchmarks/Maze/) environment. I will use Vizmo software to visualize a probabilistic roadmap planner sampling the Maze 2-dimensional environment with a boxy robot. This test will be run on the MATE Linux virtual machine named Black Widowers.

#### Step 1: Experimental Set-Up ####

Files in Experiment/Maze: 
* Environment Files: Maze-vizmo.env , maze-vizmo.env, 
* Maze Files: maze.robot, robot.g, 
* Query Files: maze.query, 
* Obstacle Files: block1.g, block2.g, block3.g (longer files with many coordinates that map each obstacle)

Understanding the Files

#### Step 2: Evaluation ####

First, I changed the code in the Problem section of the CfgExamples.xml File to match the files of the maze example that I will be testing.

Then, I ran a terminal command in the PMPL/pmpl/src Directory 
--   ./pmpl -f Examples/CfgExamples.xml   --  to run PMPL.


#### Step 3: Results ####

Running PMPL with the CfgExamples.xml produced a file titled example.12345678.query.map that represents 
the probabilistic roadmap in the maze environment. In Vizmo, I uploaded the maze-vizmo.env file to visualize 
the maze environment as well as the example.12345678.query.map file to visualize the roadmap. The roadmap 
is an undirected graph R composed of nodes and edges. The configurations are the nodes of R and the paths 
computed by the local planner are the edges of R. The image below shows the results of the 
vizmo representation of these files. Each color represents a connected component in this graph.
