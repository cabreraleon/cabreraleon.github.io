6/01/2022:
Today was my first day of research. The schedule for today
was a one hour presentation to introduce us to the Parsaol Lab,
the crash course schedule, meeting dates and expectations. 
I'm nervous yet excited about 
the challenges I will face during my research on robotics and motion planning.
